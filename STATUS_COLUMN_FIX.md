# âœ… Status Column Added to Migration

## The Problem
Your application was showing this error:
```
Could not find the 'status' column of 'subscriptions' in the schema cache
```

This happened because:
- The application code expects a `status` column (active/inactive/cancelled)
- The migration script didn't include this column
- Your existing schema doesn't have it

## The Solution
I've updated the migration script to include the `status` column.

### What Was Added:

**1. Column Definition:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.subscriptions 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS status TEXT DEFAULT 'active';
```

**2. Data Update:**
```sql
UPDATE public.subscriptions 
SET status = 'active' 
WHERE status IS NULL OR status = '';
```

**3. Constraint:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.subscriptions 
ADD CONSTRAINT subscriptions_status_check 
CHECK (status IN ('active', 'inactive', 'cancelled'));
```

## Now You Can Run the Migration

**In Supabase SQL Editor:**
```sql
-- Run the updated migration-update-schema.sql
-- It now includes the status column!
```

## What the Status Column Does

The `status` column allows you to:
- **active** - Subscription is currently active
- **inactive** - Subscription is paused/inactive
- **cancelled** - Subscription has been cancelled

This is used in the UI to:
- Filter active vs inactive subscriptions
- Show status badges on subscription cards
- Toggle subscription status on/off

## Verification

After running the migration, verify the status column exists:

```sql
-- Check the column
SELECT column_name, data_type, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'subscriptions' 
AND column_name = 'status';

-- Check your data
SELECT 
    service_name,
    status,
    cost,
    currency
FROM public.subscriptions
LIMIT 5;
```

## Expected Result

All your existing subscriptions will have `status = 'active'` by default.
